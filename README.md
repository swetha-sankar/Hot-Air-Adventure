# Hot Air Adventure

Hot air balloon adventure game created with Python and Arcade.

About:

This game consists of three levels, and challenges users to navigate a hot air balloon over buildings and collect 25 coins within a time frame of 1 minute.
The user progresses to the next level when 25 coins have been collected. 
The buildings slowly move upwards, and the coins rotate and fall from the sky at random intervals. The scope of the challenge increases as the user progresses through the levels.
Each level corresponds to a different time of day, and the background changes accordingly. For each coin that the user collects, the score increases by 1 point. 
For each building that the user collides with, the score decreases by 5 points.
